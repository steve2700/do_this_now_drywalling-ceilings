## H2: Common Countertop Questions from [Location] Homeowners

### Q1: What's the best material for kitchens in [Location]?
**Answer:** It depends on your lifestyle and budget. For busy families in [Location], we often recommend quartz (like Caesarstone) because it's non-porous, doesn't require sealing, and is highly durable. For homeowners who love natural stone aesthetics and don't mind annual sealing, granite offers timeless beauty at a lower price point. In [Location], we see a 60/40 split between granite and quartz installations.

### Q2: How long does granite installation take in [Location]?
**Answer:** From consultation to completion, expect 7-10 days:
- Day 1: Free consultation and quote
- Day 2-3: Showroom visit and stone selection
- Day 4: Professional templating at your property (45 minutes)
- Day 5-8: Fabrication (3-5 business days)
- Day 9: Installation (typically 1 day for standard kitchens)
- Day 10: Final inspection and cleanup

For [Location] clients, we can expedite to 5-7 days if urgent.

### Q3: Do you service [specific area within location]?
**Answer:** Yes! We serve all of [Location], including [list 5-8 specific suburbs/areas]. We've completed numerous installations in [specific popular area] and are familiar with the area's property types.

### Q4: What's included in your installation price?
**Answer:** Our installation includes:
- Professional digital templating

### Q5: Can you match existing granite in my [Location] home?
**Answer:** We'll do our best! Granite is natural stone, so exact matches are rare. However, we can find similar colors and patterns. Bring us a sample or photo, and we'll search our supplier network. For exact color consistency, we recommend quartz (like Caesarstone), which has uniform patterns.

### Q6: Do you install bathroom vanity tops in [Location]?
**Answer:** Absolutely! Bathroom vanity installations are one of our specialties. We install both granite and quartz vanities throughout [Location]. Popular choices for bathrooms include Kashmir White granite and Caesarstone Pure White. Bathroom vanities typically take 5-7 days from quote to installation.

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Granite countertops in [Location] range from R1,500 to R6,500 per square metre, depending on the grade and color. Standard granite costs R1,500-R2,800/m¬≤, premium granite R3,000-R4,500/m¬≤, and exotic granite R5,000-R6,500/m¬≤. Installation adds R800-R2,000/m¬≤."

      "name": "Is Caesarstone better than granite?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",

Granite is heat-resistant, more affordable (R1,500-R4,500 vs R2,800-R4,500/m¬≤), and offers natural unique patterns. Choice depends on your priorities: low maintenance (Caesarstone) vs natural beauty and heat resistance (granite)."

---

### **2. Featured Snippet Optimization**

Featured snippets = Position 0 = massive traffic boost

**How to Target Snippets:**

‚úÖ **Paragraph Snippets:**
Answer questions directly in 40-60 words:

```
**How much do granite countertops cost in Johannesburg?**

Granite countertops in Johannesburg cost R1,500 to R6,500 per square metre. 
Standard granite ranges from R1,500-R2,800/m¬≤, premium granite costs 
R3,000-R4,500/m¬≤, and exotic granite runs R5,000-R6,500/m¬≤. Installation 
adds R800-R2,000/m¬≤.
```

‚úÖ **List Snippets:**
Create numbered or bulleted lists:

```
**Steps to Install Granite Countertops:**

1. Free consultation and measurements (30 minutes)
2. Stone selection at showroom (1-2 hours)
3. Professional templating at property (45 minutes)
4. Fabrication of granite slab (3-5 days)
5. Installation and sealing (1 day)
6. Final inspection and cleanup
```

‚úÖ **Table Snippets:**
Create comparison tables:

| Material | Price per m¬≤ | Maintenance | Durability |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Granite | R1,500-R6,500 | Sealing 1-2x/year | Very High |
| Caesarstone | R2,800-R4,500 | None required | Very High |
| Silestone | R3,000-R5,000 | None required | Very High |
