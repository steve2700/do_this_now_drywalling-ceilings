## H2: Common Countertop Questions from [Location] Homeowners

### Q1: What's the best material for kitchens in [Location]?
**Answer:** It depends on your lifestyle and budget. For busy families in [Location], we often recommend quartz (like Caesarstone) because it's non-porous, doesn't require sealing, and is highly durable. For homeowners who love natural stone aesthetics and don't mind annual sealing, granite offers timeless beauty at a lower price point. In [Location], we see a 60/40 split between granite and quartz installations.

### Q2: How long does granite installation take in [Location]?
**Answer:** From consultation to completion, expect 7-10 days:
- Day 1: Free consultation and quote
- Day 2-3: Showroom visit and stone selection
- Day 4: Professional templating at your property (45 minutes)
- Day 5-8: Fabrication (3-5 business days)
- Day 9: Installation (typically 1 day for standard kitchens)
- Day 10: Final inspection and cleanup

For [Location] clients, we can expedite to 5-7 days if urgent.

### Q3: Do you service [specific area within location]?
**Answer:** Yes! We serve all of [Location], including [list 5-8 specific suburbs/areas]. We've completed numerous installations in [specific popular area] and are familiar with the area's property types.

### Q4: What's included in your installation price?
**Answer:** Our installation includes:
- Professional digital templating

### Q5: Can you match existing granite in my [Location] home?
**Answer:** We'll do our best! Granite is natural stone, so exact matches are rare. However, we can find similar colors and patterns. Bring us a sample or photo, and we'll search our supplier network. For exact color consistency, we recommend quartz (like Caesarstone), which has uniform patterns.

### Q6: Do you install bathroom vanity tops in [Location]?
**Answer:** Absolutely! Bathroom vanity installations are one of our specialties. We install both granite and quartz vanities throughout [Location]. Popular choices for bathrooms include Kashmir White granite and Caesarstone Pure White. Bathroom vanities typically take 5-7 days from quote to installation.
